## Thornthwaite-Mather Python code
We also developed a python version of the code that could be easily run also online using Google Colab resources.
The demo.py provides a basic way to use the developed code.
Required inputs are described [here](https://thornwaterbalance.com/methods.html)  

An example of input data is available [here](https://thornwaterbalance.com/example.xlsx) while the template to provide data could be download [here](https://thornwaterbalance.com/example.xlsx).

To run the code just cole the repo, adjust the CONFIG_ALG in demo.py and then run it:

    python demo.py
Results are:

 - Excel data file
 - Set of graphical plots in png format.

Dependencies could be installed using the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
